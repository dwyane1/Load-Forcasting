# Electric-Load-Forecasting
Load forecasting is a technique used by power or energy-providing companies to predict the power/energy needed to meet the demand and supply equilibrium.


# Forecasting Tools

1- Time Series

2- Regression

3- ANN


# Dataset

The load data used in this project was a Power Load Profile for a utility company.

Two types of data is used here :-

1- Hourly basis

2- Daily basis

All models are implemented on both types of data.

The load demand is measured in MW in 24 months.

Dataset consists of hourly readings(17,520 readings) of years 2009 & 2010  of a city of Malaysia.
You can get the dataset in Data directory.


# Error Criteria 

The criteria chosen to measure the accuracy of the forecast is mean absolute percentage error(MAPE) .
